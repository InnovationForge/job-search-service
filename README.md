# job-search-service (JSS)
A job search API that provides information about the latest job vacancies, salaries, and job descriptions for different industries.

## JSS Solution Design overview

Developing a job search service that provides information about the latest job vacancies, salaries, and job descriptions for different industries can be a valuable project. Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can follow to implement the desired features:
* Data Modeling: Design the data models for your application. This might include entities like Job, Industry, SalaryRange, and any other related entities you may need. Consider the relationships between these entities.
* Data Storage: Choose a database solution to store your data. Spring Boot supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Select the one that suits your needs and configure the data source.
* Job Vacancy Integration: Integrate your application with job vacancy data providers or job board APIs. Explore popular job board APIs like Indeed, LinkedIn, or CareerBuilder. Retrieve data like job titles, descriptions, company information, and application details.
* Salary Information: Integrate with salary data providers or surveys to retrieve salary information for different job positions and industries. Implement functionality to display salary ranges, average salaries, and related salary information.
* Industry Information: Provide information about different industries and job sectors. Include features like industry profiles, job market trends, and growth prospects. This information can help users explore various career options.
* Job Search: Implement functionality for users to search for job vacancies based on criteria such as job title, industry, location, or keywords. Provide search filters and sorting options to enhance the user experience.
* Job Details: Develop endpoints or functionality to display detailed job descriptions, including responsibilities, qualifications, and any other relevant information. Include features like saving job listings or applying for jobs directly through your platform.
* User Interface: Create a user-friendly interface for your job search service. You can create a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Alternatively, create a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
* User Management: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. Include features like user profiles, saved job searches, and email notifications for new job listings.
* Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing in Spring Boot.
* Deployment: Deploy your application to a hosting platform or a cloud provider. You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deployment.

Remember to handle data privacy and security concerns, and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the job search industry.

This outline should give you a starting point for developing your Job Search Service. Make sure to explore Spring Boot documentation and the documentation of the job board APIs you integrate with for detailed implementation guidance. Good luck with your project!
